# CoOp method for medical dataset

This repo is based on CoOp methond. It is changed in order to perform on medical dataset(only Covid now) and using Medclip as pretrained model.
The changes to the original code mainly include the following aspects:
- Add Covid.py in the folder dataset so that the project can load labels and images in covid dataset, and split them into train set, validate set and test set.
- Modify the train.py, a hyperparameter option-pretarined model is added. You can choose to use clip or MedCLIP as the pretrained model.
- Add a folder Medclip, the code and operations related to MedCLIP are located in this folder. They are from https://github.com/RyanWangZf/MedCLIP.
- Add some codes in trainers/coop.py, so tha we can load Medclip Model as our pretrained image encoder and text encoder. We rewritten prompt_learner() and textEncoder() for Medclip model，but maybe there are some mistakes in our MedTextencoder().The CoOp performance on Medclip is not good now.

## TIMELINE
- base Orginal code.
- baseline In this version, we add baseline.py and run zero-shot Medclip model on Covid dataset.
- Covid-clip In this version, we sucessfully run CoOp method on Covid dataset using clip as pretrained model.There are still some mistakes with using Medclip as pretrained model.

## Original Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models

This repo contains the codebase of a series of research projects focused on adapting vision-language models like [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) to downstream datasets via *prompt learning*:

* [Conditional Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05557), in CVPR, 2022.
* [Learning to Prompt for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01134), IJCV, 2022.


### How to Install
This code is built on top of the awesome toolbox [Dassl.pytorch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch) so you need to install the `dassl` environment first. Simply follow the instructions described [here](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch#installation) to install `dassl` as well as PyTorch. After that, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` under `CoOp/` to install a few more packages required by [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) (this should be done when `dassl` is activated). Then, you are ready to go.

Follow [DATASETS.md](DATASETS.md) to install the datasets.

### Models and Results

- The pre-trained weights of CoOp (both M=16 & M=4) on ImageNet based on RN50, RN101, ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 can be downloaded altogether via this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ypxfd82RR0pizc5MM1ZWDYDk4j0BtPF/view?usp=sharing). The weights can be used to reproduce the results in Table 1 of CoOp's paper (i.e., the results on ImageNet and its four variants with domain shift). To load the weights and run the evaluation code, you will need to specify `--model-dir` and `--load-epoch` (see this [script](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp/blob/main/scripts/eval.sh) for example).
- The raw numerical results can be found at this [google drive link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_kaFdD0nct9aUIrDoreY0qDunQ9q9tv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100312610418109826457&rtpof=true&sd=true).
